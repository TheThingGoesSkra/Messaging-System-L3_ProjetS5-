This is our own client-server application, allowing instant discussion with different groups of people.

Here, there are two types of different groups. Users can individually open a thread with a group of the opposite type, or open one with the one to which they belong. Other groups of the same type as theirs will remain unknown to them.

  - Display users writing
  - View online / offline status of known users by the client
  - Use possible offline and attempt automatic reconnection

The problems to solve :

  - Allow the dynamic loading of messages using the jScrollBar (The second communication already has the necessary architecture, we put in comments corresponding queries on the server side.)
